# ZombieGame

This game is a zombie survival game.

The theme is set in a post-apocalyptic world where buildings are broken, cars are abandoned etc. Something eerie.
The objective of this game is to stay alive as long as you can. The levels are basically “waves”. Each wave of zombies you kill, the next wave arrives with 2 more. Player One and Player Two are two different players competing to survive the longest. The second objective is to kill as many zombies as possible. The more zombies you kill, the more points you get. You also accumulate points for every second you survive, therefore, if someone dies earlier, they can still win if they kill more zombies.

Controls
Player One, Player Two
Moving (↑←↓→ , W A S D)
Shoot (Shift, F button)
Pause (ESC)

You can either play single player, where you try and survive by yourself, or multiplayer, where you compete to survive the longest and kill as many zombies as possible. 

The sprites/characters will be pretty simple. The characters will look like pixelated cartoon human beings with pistols. The zombies will look like… zombies. If the zombies touches the human, it is GAME OVER, for that human, if you’re playing multiplayer, otherwise you would just lose in singleplayer. The background will have walls and cars acting as barriers for the human. You can’t shoot through the cars or walls. To kill the zombies, the humans will have a “Shoot” button that will fire a bullet from the pistol. If the bullet touches the zombie, the zombie will die. There is a 1.5 second delay in every shot so you can’t just spam a stream of bullets. 

There will be a game overlay if you press ESC. It will pause the game and a menu will appear. There will be a resume game, instructions, and end game button. The resume game will… resume game. The end game… will end game. The Instructions will show the controls and the objectives of the game. 

Every 2 minutes a player survives, there will be a BIG wave of zombies. In multiplayer, there will be a 20 second period during the wave where both players will be vulnerable to each other's bullets. You can essentially kill each other if you can get past all the zombies. This is the experimental feature.
